# Betting on Colors - Photon Powered Multiplayer Gambling Game
Wanted to play around with real time position tracking and multiplayer networking using Photon.
<br>This is a quick multiplayer prototype made using Unity 3D and Photon. Place your bet by dragging chips of various values into one of two squares. 
This tracks all values over the network, real-time positioning of the chips and is optimized using techniques such as object pooling, baked lighting and, no code in Update() 
methods.
